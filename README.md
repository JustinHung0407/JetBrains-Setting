On the computer where the IntelliJ IDEA instance whose settings you want to share is installed, select File | Settings Repository from the main menu. Specify the URL of the repository you've created and click Overwrite Remote.

### Installing

Install plugin Material Theme UI

On each computer where you want your settings to be applied, in the Settings/Preferences dialog (Ctrl+Alt+S), expand the Tools node and choose Settings Repository. Specify the URL of the repository you've created, and click Overwrite Local.

You can click Merge if you want the repository to keep a combination of the remote settings and your local settings. If any conflicts are detected, a dialog will be displayed where you can resolve these conflicts.
